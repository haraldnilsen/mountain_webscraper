# Mountain Info Web Scraper

## Description
This Python script allows you to enter the name of a mountain and retrieve information about that mountain. The script uses Selenium for web automation and BeautifulSoup for HTML parsing to scrape data from `https://ut.no/`. The project was made as my first python-project back in 2019 to learn webscraping, but the code has later been refactored.
